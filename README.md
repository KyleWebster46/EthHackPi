# EthHackPi
The purpose of the EthHackPi (or educational ethical hacking & penetration testing Raspberry Pi) is to be used as a educational tool in the class room or home lab. It is meant to help teach new security professionals the basics of penetration testing and give them some baseline experience.

# What is the EthHackPi?
The EthHackPi is a vulnerable ISO that is intentionally built to be vulnerable to some pretty big exploits, and it design to be run on a simple Raspberry Pi. Since all of the vulnerabilities are built into the ISO itself, a wifi connection is not required. This means that the home labs that can be carried out against this vulnerable Raspberry Pi can be carried out anywhere, making this a great way to teach people in developing nations about information security. It can also be used in the middle school or high school computer lab with little to no risk, in order to spark curiosity in young security professionals.
# Educational uses
As previously stated, the ISO is built to be vulnerable to some large exploits, however this is useless without direction. Provided on this github page is a series of tutorials shot by myself that cover each major vulnerability and how to exploit it. The Idea is students can watch and learn how to do the exploits themselves, and eventually move into doing exploits on their own.
